"Here it is, on our left," I told Usman as he drove us past Stubb's BBQ, a popular live music venue in downtown Austin. He turned to a nearby road and stopped the car on the nearest roadside parking spot. We walked to Stubb's and went to the back of a small line that had formed on the outside of the bar. We were waiting to see Still Woozy, a fairly obscure pop artist with only five songs. The line gradually moved forward as people were admitted inside. Eventually, I had my ID checked and received a wristband. 

Inside was a tabled dining area, with a railing toward the back that overlooked a very small performance stage on the lower story of the building. On the left were the stairs leading down. We went down the steps into a small standing space sandwiched between the stage and bar. The area was already occupied by quite a few people, standing around, drinking and making conversation.

Usman and I walked to the bar to get water, then found a spot among the crowd with a clear view of the stage. As we waited for the concert to start, we noticed a few people outside a back door, all wearing oversized teal shirts

I will continue this on my phone
