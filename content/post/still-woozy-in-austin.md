"Here it is, on our left," I told Usman as he drove us past Stubb's BBQ, a popular live music venue in downtown Austin. He turned to a nearby road and stopped the car on the nearest roadside parking spot. We walked to Stubb's and went to the back of a small line that had formed on the outside of the bar. We were waiting to see Still Woozy, a fairly obscure pop artist with only five songs. The line gradually moved forward as people were admitted inside. Eventually, I had my ID checked and received a wristband. 

Inside was a tabled dining area, with a railing toward the back that overlooked a very small performance stage on the lower story of the building. On the left were the stairs leading down. We went down the steps into a small standing space sandwiched between the stage and bar. The area was already occupied by quite a few people, standing around, drinking and making conversation.

Usman and I walked to the bar to get water, then found a spot among the crowd with a clear view of the stage. As we waited for the concert to start, we noticed a few people outside a back door, all wearing oversized teal shirts. After a while, those people walked on stage and introduced themselves as TC Superstar. To my surprise, two of the five members didn’t take up any instruments at all. Instead, they situated themselves to the left and right of the singer. As the band started playing their first song, titled Toyota Corolla, the two women flanking the singer began dancing.

Everybody loved the line in the song that mentioned the Toyota Corolla. People were shouting things like, “That’s my car!” and “Mine’s a 2004!” And near the end of the song, when there was a breakdown with a reduction in tempo, the crowd went wild.

TC Superstar definitely had character. They were quirky and unashamed of the fact. During instrumental breaks, the singer would dance awkwardly, in the manner of someone who has no formal experience dancing. It was disarming, even amusing, really. I loved their set. Everyone around me did too. We all gave them a huge round of applause as they left the stage.

With Still Woozy coming up soon, the crowd became a lot more crowded. There was a rush of people pushing us forward from behind. Some were even squeezing through to get to the front.

We didn’t have to wait long.

Still Woozy walked on stage and introduced his drummer, Skinny Pete, and accompanist ?, promising that they would both be dancing later on in the set.

"Who's here with someone you love?" he asked the audience, after picking up an electric bass. Then followed smooth, synthesized beats as he began playing Cooks. Cooks was the first song by him I ever heard. Spotify had put it in my Discover Weekly playlist. I was instantly infected by the contagiously groovy hook and the head-bobbing bass line. It would be days until the earworm left me alone. In the meantime, I was impressed to learn from his Spotify artist profile that he writes and records all parts of his songs by himself, in his garage.
