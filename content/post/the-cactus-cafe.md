On Saturday evening, I had an experience so brief and unusual that I found it difficult to reconcile the event in my memory with the moments immediately before and after it. When I tried to recall the event mere hours later, I confused the timing and momentarily believed that it had occurred days ago! 

My close friend Bala was visiting campus from his apartment in North Austin, and my roommate Kunal and I had just finished eating dinner with him at Kerbey Lane Cafe. Bored and out of ideas, we decided to try and sneak in a quick game of basketball at Gregory Gym before it closed for the night. We strolled down the west side of Guadalupe, chatting the whole way, and paused at Sunset Crosswalk to wait for the pedestrian signal. Like feet, conversation too drifted to a halt. I looked out across the bustling street, one of the busiest in Austin year-round. Amid the cacophony of cars rushing past, I noticed the faint, yet distinct sound of a drum kit being played somewhere in the distance--a dead giveaway of live music. 

"I hear music," I told my friends. "I don't know where it's coming from though."

The cars stopped and the walk signal lit up. Stepping over the multicolored lines of the crosswalk, we approached the bus stop on the other side of the street, and I suddenly became aware that a man there was singing an opera tune at the top of his lungs. I was so distracted by the mystery drums that I had failed to notice this man belting out to the sky, vibrato and all, oblivious to the people walking by him. 

Stepping over the multicolored lines of the crosswalk, we approached the other side of the street. I was so distracted by the mystery drums that I failed to notice a man belting out an opera tune in front of me. I suddenly became aware of him as I stepped from the pavement onto the sidewalk. He stood next to a bus stop singing at the top of his lungs accompanied only by the sounds of the road, looking up to the sky and oblivious to the people walking by him. 

"The music's right there," Kunal said, gesturing toward the opera man. 

I rolled my eyes and opted to ignore his trolling this time. We were right in front of the University Union now. Abruptly, the drums stopped and I heard clapping and cheering that seemed to be coming from within the Union, 

"Let's go find out where it's coming from," I urged my company.

Without protest, Bala and Kunal followed me into the Union.

It was around 9:00 PM, and I was walking down Guadalupe with my roommate and my close friend, who was visiting campus from his apartment in North Austin. We were making our way toward Gregory Gym to play a bit of basketball before the gym closed. Dusk was falling quickly, and in the distance I could hear a drum kit being played. We walked over the rainbow crosswalk and past a bus station, where a man stood singing an opera-sounding tune that conspicuously clashed with the contemporary music that grew louder with each step. 

As we approached the University Union, I realized that the music was coming from inside.
