On Saturday evening, I had an experience so brief and unusual that I found it difficult to reconcile the event in my memory with the moments immediately before and after it. When I tried to recall the event mere hours later, I confused the timing and momentarily believed that it had occurred days ago! 

My close friend Bala was visiting campus from his apartment in North Austin, and my roommate Kunal and I had just finished eating dinner with him at Kerbey Lane Cafe. Bored and out of ideas, we decided to try and sneak in a quick game of basketball at Gregory Gym before it closed for the night. We strolled down the west side of Guadalupe, chatting the whole way, and paused at Sunset Crosswalk to wait for the pedestrian signal. Like feet, conversation too drifted to a halt. I looked out across the bustling street, one of the busiest in Austin year-round. Amid the cacophony of cars rushing past, I noticed the faint, yet distinct sound of a drum kit being played somewhere in the distance--a dead giveaway of live music. 

"I hear music," I told my friends.

The cars stopped and the walk signal lit up. Stepping over the multicolored lines of the crosswalk, we approached the bus stop on the other side of the street, and I suddenly became aware that a man there was singing an opera tune at the top of his lungs. I was so distracted by the mystery drums that I had failed to notice this man belting out toward the sky, vibrato and all, oblivious to the people walking by him. 

Despite the new, discordant sound filling the air, I could tell that the percussion was getting ever louder as we walked past the stop.

"Where's it coming from?" I wondered aloud.

"What are you looking for? The music's right there," said Kunal, gesturing behind us toward the opera man. 

I rolled my eyes, opting not to reward his obvious trolling with any response. Perplexingly, the music sounded closer than ever, and yet still far away. Abruptly, the drums stopped, and the sounds of clapping and cheering emanated from within the University Union.

"Let's go find out what's happening," I urged my companions.

Without protest, Bala and Kunal followed me into the building.

We could tell the performance was happening inside a room on a different floor. A quick trip up the nearest stairwell confirmed that the music was not coming from above us, so we headed down to the bottom floor. As I walked down the last few steps, I realized that the performance was happening inside the Cactus Cafe & Bar, an obscure establishment located in a corner on the bottom floor of the Union. Neither me nor any of my friends knew anything about the place. None of us had ever even wandered near its entrance. Sitting right outside the door at a register was a guy slightly older than us. I started having second thoughts about going up to the doors, considering that we are all underage. Thankfully, Bala showed less reserve.

"Let's go check it out," he said, leading the way.

We stopped before the doors, and the cashier greeted us.

"How much it is to get in?" Bala asked.

"I was just closing up this table, actually," the cashier replied. "You guys can head on in and see them play their last song if you want."

We thanked him and went inside. I blinked, blinded by the relative darkness of my new environment. The air was heavily laden with the smell of alcohol. Silhouettes took shape and became objects as my eyes adjusted to the dim lighting. The stage was across the room, on the left. It was a small, elevated wooden area with plain white lights beaming down from above, the only lighting in the entire place. Standing there was a band of four kids who looked like they were in middle school, perhaps high school at the latest. The keyboard player was in front, standing before a mic. To the right of her was the guitarist, behind her was the drummer, and to her left was the bassist.

On our right, farthest from the stage, was a small bar. Between the bar and the stage was a seating area composed of round, wooden tables. Although the nearest unoccupied table had several glasses half full of beer left on it, we sat there anyway to avoid drawing attention to ourselves. 

I watched as the keyboardist talked about how someone had mentored her and her bandmates. She then invited said person onstage. The man, who seemed to be in his 20s, went up with a white guitar and plugged it into an amplifier.
