On Saturday evening, I had an experience so brief and unusual that I found it difficult to reconcile the event in my memory with the moments immediately before and after it. When I tried to recall the event mere hours later, I confused the timing and momentarily believed that it had occurred days ago! 

My close friend Bala was visiting campus from his apartment in North Austin, and my roommate Kunal and I had just finished eating dinner with him at Kerbey Lane Cafe. Bored and out of ideas, we decided to try and sneak in a quick game of basketball at Gregory Gym before it closed for the night. We strolled down the west side of Guadalupe, chatting the whole way, and paused at Sunset Crosswalk to wait for the pedestrian signal. Like feet, conversation too drifted to a halt. I looked out across the bustling street, one of the busiest in Austin year-round. Amid the cacophony of cars rushing past, I noticed the faint sound of a drum kit being played somewhere in the distance.

It was around 9:00 PM, and I was walking down Guadalupe with my roommate and my close friend, who was visiting campus from his apartment in North Austin. We were making our way toward Gregory Gym to play a bit of basketball before the gym closed. Dusk was falling quickly, and in the distance I could hear a drum kit being played. We walked over the rainbow crosswalk and past a bus station, where a man stood singing an opera-sounding tune that conspicuously clashed with the contemporary music that grew louder with each step. 

As we approached the University Union, I realized that the music was coming from inside.
