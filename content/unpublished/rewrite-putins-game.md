Volgograd State University, 45 students hacking
Victor Minin “It looks like they’re just picking at their screens, but the battle is intense” 
7 teams, 8 hour competition, CTF challenges
Association of Chief Information Security Officers, Minin monitoring
Competitions everywhere in Russia, including large team vs team events
100s in April team event 
Left competition room, Minin says cybersecurity since 18, joined army
Doesn’t say what role in army
“At the time, I signed a gag order,” he told me, smiling slyly. “Do you think anything has changed? And that I’d say it to a journalist?”
Minin joins KGB later
After Soviet Union falls, Minin works for Russian government, cyber and surveillance
Retired in 2010, formed the earlier mentioned Association which is tied to the government: defense ministry, Federal Security Service, interior ministry
Minin says CTF to prepare kids, pass on knowledge “passing my accumulated knowledge on to the kiddies”
Tech companies use him to help hire
Ask him whether government also goes to him
“It’s possible”
“They also need these specialists.”
Lunch break, go outside, sunny windy
Uni is on steep hill, white buildings, city and river below
Was war ruins
Was Stalingrad
Haunted city
“Have you been to Mamayev Kurgan yet?”
Hill where battle changed its shape
Motherland Calls statue is there now (description)
It’s where Paulus was captured, Minin reverent
“You know, it’s important to see how young people defended their homeland.”
Cafeteria haunted, Soviet era
Looks old except students with smartphones
Sat down with Astrakhan (old city near Caspian Sea) team, said had visited
Students smirked
Anton third grader “Everyone wants to leave”
Sergei, Anton’s teammate “There’s nothing to do there”
Anton hoping to get job in state security
“It’s prestigious, they pay well, and the work is interesting”
Hoping for 500,000 rubles per month, twice avg. in Astrakhan
Ask him if it’s because of patriotism
No, he doesn’t care
“I don’t care what government I work for. If the French Foreign Legion takes me, I’ll go!”
Ask him, Isn’t it bad to say that in Volgograd
Sergei says patriotism in Russia is bad these days
Unhappy about internet restrictions, government monitoring of internet, says unconstitutional
“And if you look at the state of our roads and our cities, and how people live in our city, you want to ask, why are they spending billions of rubles on storing people’s personal information in mass ive databases?”
Classmate “They’re going to lock you up, Sergei”
Sergei “Keep chewing” unfazed
